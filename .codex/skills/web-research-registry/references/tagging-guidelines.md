# Tagging Guidelines

Use tags to improve findability and filtering across the registry. The tag list is expected to grow over time as research expands.

## Principles
- Prefer existing tags; add new tags when they are needed to describe new concepts.
- Keep tags short, lowercase, and kebab-case.
- Avoid synonyms; use one canonical tag per concept.

## Tag Types
- **Topic**: configuration, localization, collections, globals
- **Tech**: nextjs, typescript, graphql
- **Concern**: access-control, admin-ui, environment-variables
- **Lifecycle**: getting-started, installation

## Examples
- Use `configuration` for docs under /configuration/.
- Use `environment-variables` for env var guidance (not `env-vars` or `env`).
- Use `admin-ui` for UI and admin-related settings.
 
## When to Extend the Registry
- Add a new tag when no existing tag captures the concept without becoming too broad.
- Always define new tags in docs/research/web-research/tags.md with a short meaning/exemplar.
