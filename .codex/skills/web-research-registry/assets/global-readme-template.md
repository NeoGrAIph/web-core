# Web Research Registry

## Structure
- Each site gets its own subfolder (e.g. docs/research/web-research/<domain>/).
- Each site subfolder contains a local README.md with detailed page entries.
- This file is the global registry of sites and pages.
- Tag definitions live in docs/research/web-research/tags.md and are shared by all entries.
